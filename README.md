The streaming industry has been growing year over year, attracting new entrants and creating
intense competition. Streaming companies are competing for consumer attention and
subscriptions. This has led to an increase in the cost of acquisition. To mitigate this problem, the
earmark team has developed a predictive model using surveys and public data to identify if an
individual is a current streaming consumer or a high potential lead. The model allows streaming
companies an opportunity to increase their return on ad spend and overall market share. This
report outlines the process of building this predictive model, including exploratory data analysis,
data preparation, model selection, evaluation, and recommendations
